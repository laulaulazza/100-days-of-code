# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 12, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy Ruby course

**Thoughts:** Today is the official start of my #100daysofcode challenge although I've been coding at least an hour most days for weeks. I couldn't have picked a worse day to start - I've had about 4 hours broken sleep thanks to one of the tiny humans, and if that wasn't bad enough, I'm working on the Ruby course in Codecademy and gave up last night as I hit a roadblock. I am not in the mood to tackle it today!

##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
